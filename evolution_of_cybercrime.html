        <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>Before computers became easily accessible to the average person, the evolution of crime remained stagnant for centuries. Once accessible, higher-level technology was exploited for criminal acts, which drastically changes the evolution of crime. In simple terms, cyber- crime is an illegal activity that is committed or enabled using a computer. Cyber-crime  has become as frequent as it is enormously broad. As cyber-crime evolves, it poses more  difficult and frequent issues to authorities fighting cyber-crime.</p>
    </div>
<p></p>
    <div>
        <h4>What is Cybercrime?</h4>
            <p>The simplest definition of cybercrime is illegal activities committed via use of a computer. However, it is difficult to encapsulate ‘cyber-crime’ into a singular definition, as it is an extremely broad term. “Some cybercrimes are simply new variants of traditional forms of wrongdoing – such as theft and fraud – where computers are used to steal personal identifications, passwords, and credit card information,” (Dolliver, 2022). Other types of cybercrimes are impossible to commit without a computer, such as ransomware or denial of service attacks.</p>
    </div>
<p></p>
    <div>
        <p>According to Clough, there are three broad categories of cybercrime that are used to create a more accurate definition of cybercrime: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cyber-Dependent</li>
            <li>Cyber-Enabled</li>
            <li>Computer-Supported Crimes</li>
        </ul>    
    </div>
<p></p>
    <div>
        <p><b>Cyber-Dependent Crime</b></p>
            <p>A ‘cyber-dependent crime’ can only be committed using a computer. This category usually includes hacking activities such as viruses, ransomware, and denial of serve attacks.</p>
        <p><b>Cyber-Enabled Crime</b></p>
            <p> A ‘cyber-enabled crime’ is a crime that is has an increased scale through the use of a computer. Examples of cyber-enabled crimes include child-pornography, stalking, and fraud (Clough, 2014).</p>
        <p><b>Computer-Supported Crime</b></p>
            <p>The final category, ‘computer-supported crimes’ are “crimes in which the use of the computer is an incidental aspect of the commission of the crime but may afford evidence of the crime,” (Clough, 2014). Examples of this category include incriminating messages, emails or websites.</p>
    </div>
<p></p>
    <div>
        <h4>How does crime involving a digital device differ from traditional crime?</h4>
            <p>The most obvious difference is that unlike traditional crime, cyber-crime is not limited to physical location. Since the internet connects people from all over the world, it can happen to anyone, anywhere. It could be perpetrated by someone living next door or living on another continent. Another difference is that cyber-crime is much more scalable compared to physical crime. A traditional robber is only physically able to hit a handful of banks in a short period of time, but a cyber criminal could target potentially infinite sites or networks at a time. In the future, cyber-crime is bound to evolve much faster than traditional crime is. Whereas traditional crime has been pretty consistent for centuries, cyber-crime will continue to evolve just as fast as technology does.</p>
    </div>
<p></p>
    <div>
        <h4>How has the nature of crime changed as a result of pervasive technology?</h4>
            <p>According to Wexler, there are two main ways crime is evolving alongside technology. The first way crime has evolved is through the variety of computer-related crimes. This not only includes malware, ransomware, DoS attacks, Trojan Horses, and other computer-specific crimes, but also crimes such as sextortion and distribution of child pornography.</p>
            <p>The second way crime is evolving is how older types of crime are committed through a computer today. For example, drug dealers can sell much larger amounts through the dark web than they are just selling on the streets. Another example is identity theft and credit card fraud, while these crimes were still committed before computers became popular, the methods and frequency of these older crimes evolved alongside computers.</p>
    </div>
<p></p>
    <div>
        <h4>Which problems does cybercrime pose to authorities seeking to investigate it?</h4>
            <p>To authorities, the biggest barrier of cybercrime is that since cybercrime is still in its infancy, the policies and response to cybercrime are in their infancies as well. The next issue posed with cyber-crime is that it is extremely broad - there are many federal organizations that are either entirely or partially dedicated to combating cybercrime including the FBI, DOD, ICE, CISA, NISA and the DEA. 
            <p>According to the FBI archives: </p>
            <p>“The Internet presents new and significant investigatory challenges for law enforcement at all levels. These challenges include: the need to track down sophisticated users who commit unlawful acts on the Internet while hiding their identities; the need for close coordination among law enforcement agencies; and the need for trained and well-equipped personnel to gather evidence, investigate, and prosecute these cases,” <em>(FBIArchives, 2022).</em></p>
